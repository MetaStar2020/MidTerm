# MidTerm
Lighthouse Labs midterm project.

### Problem: 
How crimes changed from pre-covid to post-covid in New York City. We will tackle the problem by acting as consultants.

### Goal: 
Use clustering and statistics to make suggestions on what the municipal/police department can change their focus on during stricter periods of time or times that may be considered a crisis (ie. pandemics). This means they can focus police resources.
